# Project Overview

## Project Schedule

This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations.  

You are **responsible** for scheduling time with your squad to seek approval for each deliverable by the end of the corresponding day, excluding `Saturday` and `Sunday`.

## Project Description

When students first learn about discrete mathematics, they are usually presented with Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel. This is about a hotel that has infinitely many rooms available. So there are infinitely many guests that come..all that is needed is to move everyone down one room to fit the new guest. Similarly with buses carrying infinitely many guests, all that is needed is to move infinitely many guest down a room, and since we have infinitely many rooms we can do this. But the paradox reveals that this is the lowest level of infinity there is, namely "countably infinite sets". This means that we can count or "track" the infinite guests with the infinite rooms. There exists a correspondence. Now, the concept of a hierarchy of infinite sets is what looses most people. How can sets have larger infinites than others? Georg Cantor, a great mathematician born in the 1800s, proved that this hierarchy exists and coined the cardinality of infinite sets to be aleph-not. My project will be an interactive app that will offer a visual presentation of this concept. But instead of hilbert's hotel, since I want to show how all common numbers are expressed in terms of their infinite cardinality, (this includes; natural numbers, rational numbers, integers, real numbers, imaginary numbers and complex numbers). There will be a space like theme with different colored/sized star systems that will represent different number sets. When a user clicks on/enters in a specific number from any of the groups mentioned above there will be a window that opens up and gives a blurb about that particular group of numbers (Possible API reference) and what level of infinity they have while simultaneously the corresponding group of stars will "emit" light and come forward from the hazy space background. 

http://numbersapi.com/#random/math - this is a similar idea and a potential API to use.

Use this section to describe your final project and perhaps any links to relevant sites that help convey the concept and\or functionality.

## Wireframes

Upload images of wireframe to cloudinary and add the link here with a description of the specific wireframe.

## Priority Matrix

Include a full list of features that have been prioritized based on the `Time and Importance` Matix.  

### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 

- Find and use external api 
- Render data on page 
- Allow user to choose favorites 
- Save their choices in firebase

#### PostMVP 

- Add user auth

## Functional Components

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous  phases section try and breakdown the logic further into functional components, and by that we mean functions.  Does your logic indicate that code could be encapsulated for the purpose of reusablility.  Once a function has been defined it can then be incorporated into a class as a method. 

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. 

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invetsted | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Adding Form | H | 3hrs| 3.5hrs | 3.5hrs |
| Working with API | H | 3hrs| 2.5hrs | 2.5hrs |
| Total | H | 6hrs| 5hrs | 5hrs |

## Helper Functions
Helper functions should be generic enought that they can be reused in other applications. Use this section to document all helper functions that fall into this category.

| Function | Description | 
| --- | :---: |  
| Capitalize | This will capitalize the first letter in a string of text | 

## Additional Libraries
 Use this section to list all supporting libraries and thier role in the project. 

## Code Snippet

Use this section to include a brief code snippet of functionality that you are proud of an a brief description  

```
function reverse(string) {
	// here is the code to reverse a string of text
}
```

## Change Log
 Use this section to document what changes were made and the reasoning behind those changes.  

## Issues and Resolutions
 Use this section to list of all major issues encountered and their resolution.

#### SAMPLE.....
**ERROR**: app.js:34 Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier                                
**RESOLUTION**: Missing comma after first object in sources {} object
